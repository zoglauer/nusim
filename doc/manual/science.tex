\chapter{NuSIM and NuSTAR science}

One of the main goals of NuSIM is to predict, reproduce, and help understand NuSTAR measurements.
For this task NuSTAR can be considered as a black box, and the user only has to think about the required input data and the output data he gets from NuSIM. 

This chapter will give an overview of NuSIM science capabilities, the required user inputs, how to perform the simulations, and the output the user can expect from NuSIM. This chapter therefore can be considered as a quick start guide to NuSIM.
