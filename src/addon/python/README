nusim_cfg.py is a simple python interface to nusim configuration files.  The main
motivation is being able to script runs of nusim, e.g.,
- looping through having a point source at various positions on the detector
  (and maybe later automatically checking output as a unit test)
- checking count rates, etc. for science targets, maybe later by directly reading
  observing plans / RPS forms
- running nusim on spatial complex regions where there are many sources esp. where
  you want to iterate through possible spectral models for each source

More ambitiously
- Querying online source lists (e.g., BAT) for sources with ~ 1 deg. of a pointing to
  check ghost rays
- Scripts to generate responses from raytracing for a given (actual) observation
- Scripts to replicate a real observation (or add artificial sources to a real obs. to
  check completeness although SciSIM is probably better for this)

nusim_cfg.py can be run as a stand-alone program to just report some aspects of what
 is in a nusim config. file. E.g.,
python nusim_cfg.py resource/configurations/AstrophysicsMode.cfg 
Read resource/configurations/AstrophysicsMode.cfg
NuSIM version that saved this configuration file = 449
Total observation time = 200.0 ks
1 pointing(s) defined
Pointing 1:
(83.637000, 22.014500) 5 34 32.88 22 0 52.2 yaw=180.0 deg., exposure time = 100.0 ks

1 source(s)
Source 1:  Astromode - Crab
  spectral option = PowerLaw
  spatial option = FarFieldPoint
  flux = 3.0276 ph/s/cm^2
  Position = (83.633200, 22.014500) 5 34 31.97 22 0 52.2
  offsets from pointing centers:
    Pointing 1: offset = 0.211'



simulate_point_powerlaw.py is an example of simply reading in AstrophysicsMode.cfg,
changing the exposure time, writing out the new cfg file and then running nusim 
non-interactively.  Hopefully this is good enough primer for now on how other changes
to the nusim configuration can be made.  Obviously the diagnostic output of nusim can
be parsed here also.
