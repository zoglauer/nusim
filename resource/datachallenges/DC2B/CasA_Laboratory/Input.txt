Input for CasA-Laboratory - DC2B sims:

(1)
SNR:
Image: Chandra 4-6 keV (shrunk by 65.85% of its original value)
Spectrum: 1.5*E^-3 ph/cm2/s/keV (expected value from Stephen Reynolds EXCLUDING thermal component!)

Ti:
Image: Chandra Fe-K (shrunk by 65.85% of its original value)
Spectrum: 67.9 keV with Gaussian-broadening of ~2 keV FWHM (0.85 keV = 1 sigma)
Flux: 5.0*10^-4 ph/cm2/s -- 20x stronger than expected (2.5*10^-5 ph/cm2/s)

(2)
Disk with 0.03 degree radius and the CasA (SNR + Ti) flux and spectrum as in (1) on differemt wafer

(3)
Ti as in (1) on different wafer with doubled flux


Pointing
Single pointing putting SNR from (1) in center of wafer optical-axis wafer is on
